Drum scheduler - app for assisting in my drum practice sessions. So far it contains:
- API (Deno)
- admin-client (Next.js)

Next step is a mobile app (technology yet needs to be choosen, but it's probably going to be React Native). 
It will read practice sessions and allow to play exercises included in session (as metronome in given BPM). This way user/drummer can follow all major steps for a given drum practice session one by one, with focus and clear goals.
